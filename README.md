# cuda-learn
Following [this course from NVIDIA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/) and [this book](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/programming-massively-parallel-processors/hwu/978-0-323-91231-0)

Learning to code using [these puzzles](https://github.com/srush/gpu-puzzles?tab=readme-ov-file) @ [this repo](https://github.com/arnavarora1710/cuda-learn/tree/main)

Plan to follow up with [learning about ML compilers](https://mlc.ai/)
